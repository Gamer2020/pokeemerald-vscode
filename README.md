# pokeemerald-vscode
These are files to add to your pokemerald project folder if you are using vscode. I decided to focus these files towards pokeemerad but the concepts should work for other GBA projects. As time goes on I will add improvements, instructions, etc. Pull requests are welcome!

For windows, please note that you will have to edit the folder location for mGBA. Simply find and replace the below.

```
"/mnt/c/DrivePrograms/mGBA/mGBA.exe"
```
